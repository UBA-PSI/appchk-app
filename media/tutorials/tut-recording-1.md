# What are Recordings?

Similar to the default logging, recordings will intercept every request and log it for later review. App recordings are usually 1 – 4 minutes long and cover a single application. You can utilize recordings for app analysis or to get a ground truth on background traffic.

Optionally, you can help us by providing your app recordings. With your findings we can create a community driven privacy monitor. The research results will help you and others avoid apps that, unnecessarily, share data with third-party providers.
