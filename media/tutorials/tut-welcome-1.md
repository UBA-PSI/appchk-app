AppCheck helps you identify which applications communicate with third parties. It does so by logging network requests. AppCheck learns only the destination addresses, not the actual data that is exchanged.

Your data belongs to you. Therefore, monitoring and analysis take place on your device only. The app does not share any data with us or any other third-party. Unless you choose to.
