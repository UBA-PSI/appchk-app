# How to record?

Before you begin, there are two types of recordings: app specific recordings and general background activity. The former are usually 3 – 5 minutes long, the latter need to be at least an hour long.

### Important notice

During the recording all logging filter are paused. This means blocked domains are not being blocked and ignored domains show up regardless. This is necessary for comparability reasons.

## App recording

Before you begin make sure that you quit all running applications and wait a few seconds. Tap on the 'App' recording button and switch to the application you'd like to inspect. Use the App as you would normally. Try to get to all corners and functionality the App provides. When you feel that you have captured enough content, come back to _AppCheck_ and stop the recording.

## Background recording

Will answer one simple question: What communications happen while you aren't using your device. You should solely start a background recording when you know you aren't going to use your device in the near future. For example, before you go to bed.
As soon as you start using your device, you should stop the recording to avoid distorting the results.

## Afterwards

Upon completion you will find your recording in the section below. You can review your results and remove any user specific information if necessary.
